               <font face="arial"  color=blue> Appianing Asubonteng Dorothy is my name. I love all. My mother loves me because of that. At times, things are cool and at times too........It really takes the grace of God for things to change. <br>
               <p> I love exploring. I love all. All and sundry are fallible and so, I hurt to be compared to someone. I have plans to build websites for people not for many sake but to let the world know what they are doing.</p> <br>
               I love being me and so be it. This is me. I am really grateful for the opportunity that met me along the line by Ms. Janat Issifu to learn web design. <br> it has not been easy but I will say that God will surely see me through.
               Love the heart that hurts you, but never hurt the heart that loves you. <br>
              <p> To my tutor, Sir Abagna, I say God bless you. To Mr. Marfo, God be with you. To Mrs. Hikmat, I love you. Janat my mother, I love you. Sharine, Andrews, Diana, Kwame, Sussana, Rebecca my maama I say a very big thank you for the love and kindness you have shown us. <br></p>
               THANK YOU!</font>
