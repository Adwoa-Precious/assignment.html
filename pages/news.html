               Good morning and welcome to today's edition of the Student Agenda Ghana. My name Predy and I
                will be your host for today. <br> <br> The headlines: <br> 1. Grassroots hub organizes training for 
                females in Sunyani. <br> 2. Final year students go back to school. <br> 3. I can't do this 
                anymore- A student said. <br> <br>
               <p>Now the news in details: <br>
               On the 18th June, 2020, there was a flyer circulation on social and the content was about the fact that,
                technology is the main deal of the day but in sunyani almost 75% of workers or businesses here do not have websites. This made the Grassroots hub collaborate with other organizations in sunyani
                to help get people on board. Why ladies? We got to know from the Co-founder that '
                Ladies feel inferior and they are being looked down due to the fact that the other side 
                things ladies can not build themselves. And this came to being because they wanted ladies to
                 also be web designer and not guys.'Mr. Emmanuel Marfo said this. This is an interesting course
                  and besides they will be able to use it in their day to day activity. The manager of hub, Ms. Janat 
                  Issifu also said that 'By the end of their 2 weeks training, they will get to know how important web 
                  is and also help create employment.' </p>
               <p> Final years go back to school. We are all hoping for excellence. Everything happens for
                    a reason and so as they go back to school, they will surely pick up and finish their 
                    courses. Although majority of the school have completed their project work and 
                    submitting their work online that is for the tertiary institute. As the pandemic haas not left the system yet, we will
                go by the measures that is washing your hands under running water with soap and also wearing of nose or face mask. It will help us minimize the spread of the virus. </p>
                <p>
                    A final year student after returning back from home realized that all her things in her room were gone. She then shouted that
                    'I can't to this anymore'. Upon having a talk with her, we realized that, that was her fourth time she was been attacked. Upon talking with her, she agreed to stay safe and complte school without having a change of mind.
                </p>
